3rd party Dependencies
----------------------

- `scrapy <http://scrapy.org/>`_'s `HtmlXPathSelector <http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/selectors.html#scrapy.selector.HtmlXPathSelector>`_ : because any BeautifulSoup-based app is an half-assed implementation of XPath anyway.
- `BeautifulSoup <http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>`_ :
  Quickly navigate data from html pages (legacy, will probably be replaced by scrapy at some point)
- `chardet <http://chardet.feedparser.org/>`_ : useful to fight encoding issues
